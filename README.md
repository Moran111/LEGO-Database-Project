# LEGO-Database-Project

Objective: 

This dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database. This a very rich data set. We plan to explore How have the size of sets changed over time? What colors are associated with witch themes? Could you predict which theme a set is from just by the bricks it contains? What sets have the most-used pieces in them? What sets have the rarest pieces in them? Have the colors of LEGOs included in sets changed over time?
